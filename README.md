munin-docsis
============

A munin plugin to graph the utilization of the own DOCSIS segment.

On the hardware side a DVB-C card or USB stick which is supported
by the used Linux kernel is required.

This is based on the Munin plugin previously published by Falk Husemann
but expands its support to non Sundteck DVB-C interfaces.
